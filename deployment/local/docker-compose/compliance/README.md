# Compliance Server

This folder contains some necessary information about the Gaia-X Lab Compliance Service.
For more information, take a look at the [Gitlab Documentation](https://gitlab.com/gaia-x/lab/compliance/gx-compliance).

## Preparing the Compliance Server for BDD-Tests

The compliance server needs a certificate.
This certificate can be generated by using the following command:

```
$ openssl req -nodes -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -sha256 -days 1460
```

The certificate and its key must be set within `.bdd-tests.env`.
Some information can be set for the certificate, for example:

```
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:DE
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:
Locality Name (eg, city) []:
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:localhost
Email Address []:
```
